## Automatic GCP Detector
To carry on various photogrammetry operation, there is a need of accquiring some sort of correspondences between Image and World Cordinate Systems. GCP's help in providing this correspondences, in different scenarios, be it generating ortho-mosaics, DSM or DEMS, etc. But getting this information about GCP's is a hectic task; In world-frame it is obtained very accurately using some specialized GPS units. And in images it is done by extracting the image cordinates of GCP's, manually, which is very much human-intensive. This module helps in automating the latter half of acquiring correspondences, using the amalgamation of Computer-Vision and Neural-Networks
